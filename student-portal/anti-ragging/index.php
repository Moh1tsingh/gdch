            <p>
                Ragging in India is damaging form of interaction of the seniors in college or school with the juniors, newcomers or first years.
            </p>
            <p>
                Raggin involves abuse, humiliation or harassment of new entrants or junior students by the senior students. It often takes a malignant form wherein the newcomers may be subjected to psychological or physical torture.

            </h1>
            <p>
                In 1999, the Government of Maharashtra enacted the Maharashtra Prohibition of Ragging Act, 1999 to prohibit ragging which, it defines as the:
                    "Display of disorderly conduct, doing of any act which cause physical or psychological harm or raise apprehension or fear or shame or embarrassment to a student in any educational institution and includes - 1. teasing, abusing, threatening or playing practical jokes on, or causing hurt to, a student, or 2. asking a student to do any act or perform something which the student will not willingly do in ordinary course."

                VARIOUS FORMS OF RAGGING
            </h1>
            <li>
                Academic performance: The seniors may attempt to harass or threaten the junior to complete their assignments, bunk classes, not to take part in any college activity.
            </li>
            <li>
                Physical abuse: The fresher are asked to do various tasks, such as sit-ups or push-ups, being forced to address seniors as 'Sir' or removing their shirts. On an attempt to resist carrying out the activities, they may beat the fresher with baseball bats or slap them.
            </li>
            <li>
                Verbal Torture: Involves indulging in loose talks. The freshmen may be asked to sing the lyrics of any vulgar song or use abusive language in presence of a large number of peers.
            </li>
            <li>
                Dress code ragging: The freshmen are asked to dress in specific dress code for a particular period of time. The dress code prescribed generally unusual, eg. dressing completely in white or black with hair oiled and combed in particular styles, dressing long skirts for girls. Dress code ragging may make freshman feel uncomfortable, as it often brings them unnecessary attention from everybody else.

                THE PSYCHOLOGY BEHIND RAGGING:
            </h1>
            <li>
                Discrimination based on cast, region, language, class, etc. plays a vital role in influencing it, especially in small cities and towns.
            </li>
            <li>
                Ragging is used as a measuring rod to test the courage of the seniors. Many seniors who are reluctant to rag, finally succumb to peer pressure. Many seniors rag just to stay in their group of friends.
            </lli>
            <li>
                In many instances it starts as a healthy interaction but due to adrenaline rush and excitement in the group seniors get carried away and ragging turns ugly.
            </li>
            <li>
                Students consider ragging as an old ritual having social acceptance
            </li>

            <p>
                If you are scared of ragging, here are some steps you should take to deal with it:
            </p>
            <li>
                Don't be afraid to raise the voice.
            </li>
            <li>
                Don't assume anything in mind.
            </li>
            <li>
                Before joining the college, we often think that ragging is about the harassment on juniors by the seniors. We make presumptions about ragging that it will always be in bad shape. There is possibility that it can be only for an introduction when seniors may ask you to introduce yourself.
            </li>
            <li>
                Get united with your friends.
            </li>
            <li>
                Seniors mostly rag the persion who seems weak and alone. So, get united with your friends and share things with them.
            </li>
            <li>
                Seek help from your college authority.
            </li>
            <li>
                Take help of Anti-ragging committee of college.
            </li>
            <li>
                Involve your parents.
            </li>
            <li>
                No one can help you better than your parents. Talk to your parents about whatever is happening with you at college. They can counsel you during tough time.
            </li>
