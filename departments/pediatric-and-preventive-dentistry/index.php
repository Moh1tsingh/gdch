            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>
                The Department of Pediatric and Preventive Dentistry, Chhtrapaji
              Sambhajinagar was established in 1985. The department aims at the
              diagnosis & treatment of dental caries and its sequel, teeth
              malformations and discolorations, thereby restoring the teeth to
              full function in an aesthetically pleasing manner. Pediatric
              Dentistry is the branch of Dentistry which is concerned with
              comprehensive preventive and therapeutic oral health care of
              children from birth through adolescence. An upcoming field of
              dentistry with immense potential, paediatric dentistry aims to
              eliminate fear at an early age with the inculcation of positive
              attitudes. The Department of Pediatric and Preventive Dentistry,
              Chhtrapaji Sambhajinagar caters to maintain a perfect blend of
              both the clinical and academic arenas of the field. Scope ranges
              from prenatal counseling of parents to all the dental treatments
              upto 13 years of age. Dental Care of the medically and mentally
              compromised patients is also taken care of. Undergraduate students
              are given discussions on a wide range of topics with special
              attention placed on interactive case history discussions as well
              as first hand clinical experience under specialist supervision.
              They are also encouraged to participate in seminars and posters in
              order to get introduced to the changing trends and to evoke a
              fresh interest in the subject. As interns they are trained to deal
              and expertly manage patients of various age groups with special
              emphasis on their clinical application of behavior management
              techniques. The Department is situated in left wing of the college
              on the second floor. The department has one large clinical section
              where both the basic treatment procedures as well as advanced
              treatments are made available. There is a presence of spacious
              waiting area. We have a separate unit to treat children with
              Special Health Care to render proper isolation and comfort to the
              children. The department also has a well isolated sterilization
              area, a preclinical lab and play room.
