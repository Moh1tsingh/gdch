            <p>
                Oral pathology is at the confluence of basic sciences and clinical
            dentistry. It deals with nature, identification and management of
            diseases of oral and maxillofacial structures. It is the science
            that investigates the causes, process & effects of these diseases.
            It utilizes various means like cytology, biopsy, biochemical
            investigations & advanced investigative techniques (e.g. IHC & PCR)
            for accurate diagnosis and further patient management.
