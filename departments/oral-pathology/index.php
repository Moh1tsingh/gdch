            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>
                Oral pathology is at the confluence of basic sciences and clinical
            dentistry. It deals with nature, identification and management of
            diseases of oral and maxillofacial structures. It is the science
            that investigates the causes, process & effects of these diseases.
            It utilizes various means like cytology, biopsy, biochemical
            investigations & advanced investigative techniques (e.g. IHC & PCR)
            for accurate diagnosis and further patient management.
            Oral Pathology is the speciality of dentistry & discipline of pathology that deals with the nature,
            identification & management of disease affecting the oral & maxillofacial regions (the mouth
            & jaw area). It is a science that investigates the causes, processes, & effects of these diseases.
